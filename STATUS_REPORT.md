# Opinion Front UI - Status Report

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Core Architecture
- **Micro-kernel Architecture**: Central `LayoutContext` kernel with pluggable components and services
- **Service-Oriented Architecture**: Dependency injection with service registry and interface contracts
- **Component Lifecycle Management**: Abstract `PageComponent` base class with init/destroy patterns
- **Layout System**: CSS Grid + Flexbox hybrid layout with responsive design
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing with ES2020 target and comprehensive type definitions

### 2. Event-Driven Communication System
- **EventBus Interface**: Comprehensive event communication system supporting publish/subscribe/request patterns
- **LayoutContext Integration**: EventBus fully integrated into LayoutContextImpl with proxied methods
- **Component Management**: Consumer tracking and cleanup functionality for proper lifecycle management
- **Error Handling**: Robust error boundaries and event handling patterns
- **Active Page System**: Page-level event coordination and lifecycle management

### 3. Chain-Based Hotkey System
- **ChainHotkeyManager**: Priority-based hotkey handling with chain execution and conflict resolution
- **Provider System**: Components implement `ChainHotkeyProvider` for hotkey registration
- **ESC Key Chain Resolution**: Modal dialogs ‚Üí Sidebar ‚Üí Menus ‚Üí Pages with cooperative handling
- **Legacy Compatibility**: Automatic adapter for legacy `registerHotkey()` calls
- **Dynamic Enable/Disable**: Individual hotkeys and entire providers can be toggled
- **Test Coverage**: 86% coverage with comprehensive chain execution scenarios

### 4. Reactive Data Binding & Observables
- **Observable Pattern**: Reactive data binding with automatic change notifications
- **ComputedObservables**: Derived values with dependency tracking and caching
- **Validators & Transformers**: Data validation and transformation pipelines
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with generic observable types
- **Test Coverage**: 87% coverage with comprehensive reactive behavior tests

### 5. Hierarchical Breadcrumbs System
- **Page-Scoped Operations**: Safe breadcrumb management where pages can only modify their scope
- **Parent Protection**: Breadcrumbs above current page level remain untouched
- **Fallback Behavior**: Append-only mode when page ID not found in hierarchy
- **PageContext Integration**: Automatic hierarchical manager instantiation
- **Case-Insensitive Search**: Smart page scope resolution with fallbacks

### 6. Comprehensive Test Infrastructure
- **Jest Configuration**: JSDOM environment with comprehensive test setup
- **564 Tests**: Extensive test suite with 43% overall coverage
- **High-Quality Coverage**: 90% events, 86% hotkeys, 87% observables, 100% config
- **Component Testing**: DOM integration, lifecycle, and responsive behavior
- **Integration Testing**: EventBus communication, hotkey chains, breadcrumb scoping
- **Architecture Testing**: Service registration, dependency injection, error handling

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture Benefits

### Event Communication
```typescript
// Publishers can emit events
layoutContext.publish('sidebar-toggled', { isCompact: true });

// Consumers can subscribe to events  
layoutContext.consume('sidebar-toggled', (data) => {
  console.log('Sidebar state changed:', data);
});

// Request-response patterns supported
const result = await layoutContext.request('get-user-preferences', {});
```

### Safe Context Access - Hybrid Pattern

**App-level Setup (required pattern):**
```typescript
// Execute callback when LayoutContext becomes ready
layout.onContextReady((ctx) => {
  ctx.getSidebar()?.updateNavigation(items);
  ctx.getHeader()?.updateUser(user);
}).init();
```

**Page-level Operations (direct access):**
```typescript
// Pages extending PageComponent can access context directly
class MyPage extends PageComponent {
  protected async onInit() {
    // Direct access for legitimate page operations
    this.layoutContext.subscribe('sidebar-compact-mode-change', this.handleSidebarChange);
    this.layoutContext.getMessages()?.showSuccess('Page loaded');
  }
}
```

### Component Lifecycle Management
- Automatic consumer cleanup on component destruction
- Memory leak prevention through proper unsubscription
- Component-based event consumer tracking

### 5. Access Pattern Enforcement
- **Hybrid Access Model**: App-level setup uses `onContextReady()`, pages use direct access
- **Removed Direct Layout Access**: `Layout.getLayoutContext()` method removed
- **Architectural Boundaries**: Clear separation between setup and operational access
- **Migration Complete**: App.ts updated to use handler pattern

## üèóÔ∏è Current Development Status
