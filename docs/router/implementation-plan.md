# Router Implementation Plan

## Mission
Implement router system for Opinion Frontend UI that:
- Uses Wouter as core routing engine
- Follows service-based architecture
- Provides entity-based routing
- Maintains account-level context
- Integrates with existing LayoutContext

## POC Implementation
Verify core architectural decisions and integration patterns.

### POC Components
1. **Base Structure**
   - RouterContext (coordinator)
   - EntityRouter (base class)
   - MainRouter (root routing)
   - DebugRouter (example entity)

2. **Integration Points**
   - Wouter basic setup
   - LayoutContext connection
   - Router hierarchy

### POC Validation
- Compile and run basic routing
- Verify router coordination
- Test entity router pattern

### POC Cleanup Options

1. **Complete Rollback**
```bash
# Remove POC files
rm -rf src/router/core/poc/*
git checkout -- src/router/core/
```

2. **Migrate to Full Implementation**
- Move RouterContext and EntityRouter to final location
- Remove POC-specific components
- Keep successful patterns
- Update imports in existing files
- Remove debug router example

3. **Refactor Steps**
- Extract reusable patterns
- Move to proper architecture
- Update documentation
- Add proper tests
- Remove temporary code

## Phase 1: Core Foundation
Required for all subsequent phases, establishes basic routing functionality.

### Task 1.1: Router Context
- [ ] Create RouterContext interface
- [ ] Implement basic path and parameter management
- [ ] Add routing state handling
- [ ] Unit tests for context functionality
- [ ] Review and validation

### Task 1.2: Base Router Service
- [ ] Install and configure Wouter
- [ ] Create RouterService interface
- [ ] Implement basic navigation methods
- [ ] Add core routing functionality
- [ ] Unit tests for base service

### Task 1.3: Entity Router Base
- [ ] Create EntityRouter abstract class
- [ ] Implement service pattern integration
- [ ] Resolve RouterContext dependency
- [ ] Basic routing tests
- [ ] Integration verification

## Phase 2: Entity Implementation
Focuses on entity-specific routing functionality.

### Task 2.1: Surveys Router
- [ ] Create SurveysRouter implementation
- [ ] Add survey-specific route handling
- [ ] Implement route registration
- [ ] Unit tests for survey routes
- [ ] Integration tests with RouterContext

### Task 2.2: Route Pattern Validation
- [ ] Test nested route handling
- [ ] Verify parameter extraction
- [ ] Validate path composition
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Pattern documentation

## Phase 3: Integration
Connects router system with existing application components.

### Task 3.1: LayoutContext Integration
- [ ] Register router services
- [ ] Implement service lifecycle
- [ ] Add dependency management
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance verification

### Task 3.2: Authentication Flow
- [ ] Implement auth route handling
- [ ] Add public route exceptions
- [ ] Test auth integration
- [ ] Security validation
- [ ] Documentation update

## Phase 4: Additional Routers
Implement remaining entity routers following established patterns.

### Task 4.1: Collectors Router
- [ ] Create CollectorsRouter implementation
- [ ] Add nested routing under surveys
- [ ] Implement route handlers
- [ ] Unit and integration tests

### Task 4.2: Reports Router
- [ ] Create ReportsRouter implementation
- [ ] Add multi-context mounting
- [ ] Test reusability
- [ ] Integration verification

## Validation Strategy

### For Each Task
1. Implement core functionality
2. Write and run tests
3. Review with team
4. Document decisions
5. Get approval before proceeding

### Key Checkpoints
- After Phase 1: Core routing functionality
- After Phase 2: Entity router pattern validation
- After Phase 3: Integration completeness
- After Phase 4: Full system verification

## Success Criteria
1. All tests passing
2. Clean integration with LayoutContext
3. Type-safe routing implementation
4. Proper error handling
5. Documentation complete
6. Performance requirements met

## Task Completion Requirements

### End of Task Checklist
1. Verify all implementations:
   - Compilation success
   - All tests passing
   - Integration verified

2. Documentation:
   - Update implementation plan progress
   - Document any architectural decisions/changes
   - Create proposals for architecture updates if needed

3. Review and Approval:
   - Discussion session for architectural implications
   - Review any proposed architecture changes
   - Get approval to proceed to next task

4. Source Control:
   - Create commit with task state
   - Tag if completing a phase
   - Update progress tracking

### End of Phase Requirements
- All phase tasks completed
- Full compilation check
- Complete test suite passing
- Architecture document reviewed and updated if needed
- Phase completion tagged in source control

## Notes
- No task is complete until all tests pass
- Architecture changes require discussion and approval
- Track all decisions and their rationale
- Regular compliance checks with architecture
